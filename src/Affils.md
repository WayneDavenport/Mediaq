**Important Considerations:**

* **Commission Rates:** Compare commission rates across different programs to find the best fit for your niche.  
* **Cookie Duration:** Look for programs with longer cookie durations, as this increases your chances of earning a commission.  
* **Promotional Materials:** Choose programs that offer a variety of promotional materials, such as banners, text links, and product feeds.  
* **Support:** Consider the level of support offered by the affiliate program, especially if you're new to affiliate marketing.

Remember to carefully review the terms and conditions of each affiliate program before you sign up. Good luck\!

**3\. Handling Regional Differences:**

* **JustWatch Regional Support:** JustWatch is very good at handling regional differences. Their API allows you to specify the user's country, so you get accurate availability for their location.  
* **User Location:** In your Next.js app, you'll need to determine the user's location. You can use:  
  * **Geolocation API (Browser-Based):** Ask the user for permission to access their location. This is the most accurate but requires user consent.  
  * **IP Geolocation (Server-Side):** Use a service to determine the user's location based on their IP address. Less accurate but doesn't require user permission.
